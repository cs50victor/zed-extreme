An opinionated personal fork of [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) featuring experimental capabilities not currently on the official roadmap. This fork explores an  approach to achieving "code at the speed of thought."

**Note:** This project is not affiliated with the Zed team. It's a personal fork implementing features I find essential that aren't prioritized in the near-term roadmap. I maintain this fork in my spare time as an exploration to help speed up productivity at my full-time job.
